COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification
This repository contains the code and report for a project focused on classifying COVID-19 cases using chest X-ray images through deep learning techniques. 

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify chest X-ray images into one of four categories, including COVID-19. The dataset used consists of 6500 chest X-ray images divided into four classes. The project involves several steps, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, including efforts to handle imbalanced data and improve model performance through various techniques.

Covid Type Classification.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the entire project, including data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualizations.
Multi-Class Classification Report.pdf: This report provides a detailed explanation of the methodologies used, the results obtained, and a discussion of the challenges faced during the project, particularly the issue of class imbalance.

The project demonstrates the potential of CNNs in medical image classification, particularly for COVID-19 diagnosis. 
However, it also underscores the importance of addressing data imbalance and exploring advanced techniques to improve model performance in such challenging tasks.
